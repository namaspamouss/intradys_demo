# Intradys Demo

Here is a demo for an intradys entry level project


## Description
Goal here is to demonstrate a basic usage of Babylon JS. We want to show a 3d model and interact with  in a full-stack context.

Specs:
- a database (here SQLite)
- back-end & front-end with Django (Python framework)
- Babylon JS
- JQuery (for ajax calls mostly)
- Materialize CSS for a better look

Notes:
<strong>Almost everything here is not secured and so, shouldn't be used in a production environment</strong>



## Usage

<code> 
git clone<br>
python3.8 -m venv env<br>
source env/bin/activate<br>
cd intradys_demo/<br>
python -m pip install requirements.txt<br>
python manage.py runserver<br>
</code>

project should now be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000
